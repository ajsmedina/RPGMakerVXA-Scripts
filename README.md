# RPGMakerVXA-Scripts
A collection of scripts written in a form of Ruby, RGSS3, to extend the capabilities of the RPG Maker VXAce systems.

These scripts were originally hosted on pastebin and shared on https://www.rpgmakercentral.com/

The most popular script can be found here on the site: https://www.rpgmakercentral.com/topic/2562-vts-enemy-hp-bars-with-boss-bars/

These scripts add various new systems to the RPG Maker VXAce game engine and writing this code allowed to me to add features I wanted into
my games as well as help other people add features to their games.
